# gis-processing
Methods for geoprocessing tasks written out step by step, because tasks always need to be used again!

We often have geo-processing tasks which require research to determine the best and fastest methods of 
doing something. Then the research is done, the task is completed, and we forget all we learned. This repo
is simply to record the steps of geoprocessing tasks, so that when they need to be completed again, this repo
can be referred to.
